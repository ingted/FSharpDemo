Scopes are Instruments where the ""scope_type_id"" column is not null (which should link to the ""HL_ScopeType"" table, but evidently there are cases where the data is invalid and the link is not correct). 

There are some ways to map this entity model to the database, but after evaluating these solutions and further discussion, it seems like the best way moving forward would be to do the following: 

# Create an Instrument entity that holds all of the information from current Scope entity. 
# Map the Instrument entity, rather than the Scope entity, to the HL_Item table. 
# Modify Scope to be unmapped but derive from the Instrument entity. 
# Modify the queries that were previously on the Scope entities to use the Instrument entity instead (and also ensure that Scope queries are filtering just the scope items from the total list of all Instruments). 
# Where the Scope object is needed, create a mapping object from Instrument to Scope.

Subject: Containers 

Bryant, 

Will you make a note to talk about automatic actuals when reviewing containers? 
We need to think of a better route to treat items that need a count sheet but do NOT 
have a container that they can be placed inside of for sterilization. 
IE: wrapped items: Curette Set 
We struggle with this at every site and the automatic actuals process doesn’t seem 
to give them traceability. Maybe I misunderstand but I don’t see it as helpful at instrument level. 

Thanks,

public class InstrumentViewModel

public class ProductViewModel

public string VendorName { get; set; } 

public string VendorProductName { get; set; }

public string Description => IsGeneric

{code} 

So the output columns for the user will be as follows:

*Product Name (Alias):* {{InstrumentViewModel.Product.VendorProductName}} and {{InstrumentViewModel.Product.Alias}}

{panel:title=(i) Notes} 
* Select the option labeled ""Automatic Actuals"" if this container definition is for a set of marked instruments that will not be tracked at the actual instance level. Censitrac will automatically manage the creation and deletion of the actuals as trays are assembled and disassembled. All historical data will be consolidated and displayed throughout Censitrac under the container name without any reference to a sequence number. This option would normally be used for sets of marked instruments that do not have a permanent physical container. 
* Apparently 'Automatic Actuals' is represented by HL_Set.parent_set_id is NULL and HL_Set.disposable_flag is 'Y', representing enable Automatic Actuals and 'N' representing... manual actuals? 
* Container.asp's code further reinforces this by using a variable named 'fDisposable' to drive the 'automatic actual' logic. 
* Apparently the set_id for an automatic actual will be the letter 'D' with the container definition / type's set_id. Example: D1103 for a container type with set_id of 1103. 
* Here is a demonstration of Automatic Actuals:

Access to update Indicator Results can be limited by the Competency Module. See Indicator Results Competency for more details.

I can select a Positive or Negative Result for all Indicators that should have been in the load, or NA if the indicator was not actually included. The expected result will be the leftmost column under Result.

Permissions that affect this page: Load Results: Issue a recall for the contents of a load. Access to update Load Results can be limited by the Competency Module. See Load Results Competency for more details. 

The specific fields displayed on this page are controlled by the configuration set up on the Load Details for the group the machine belongs to.  (See Modifying Sterilizer Group Settings for more information). Available fields are: Location, Load Number, Load Scanned, Added, Load Result, Alarm, Cycle, Sterilant Batch, Case Reference, Reason, Temperature, Sterilization Time, Dry Time, Saved, Notes. 

Load Number: 
* If I come directly into this page, I can search for a Load Number, or enter one directly. 
* If I scan a Sterilizer Location, the search results will be limited to that Sterilizer. 
* If multiple Facilities exist, the search results will be limited to Locations within that Facility. 
* If the load number is not found after scanning a location and searching for an exact load number, the search function will then search for that load number in all locations for the facility that was selected during the user's login process. 
* In order to search for load numbers that begin with the same pattern, enter the criteria in the ""load Number"" box.  By entering the criteria followed by an asterisk, the search results are limited to load numbers that begin with the same pattern.  For example, in order to display a list of load numbers beginning with ""020806"", enter ""020806*"" in the ""load Number"" field, and then press or click the ""Search"" button.   
* If I navigated into this page from another, the Load Number will be prefilled. 
* If the Load number was a user entered one, I can update it, if it was automatically assigned by Censitrac, it cannot be changed. See Modifying Sterilizer Group Settings for more information. 
* If I scan any label that is not a Location, I will get a Stop message. 
* If I scan a Location Label that is not a Sterilizer, I will get a Stop message. 

I can view the Location, Load Number, Load Scanned Timestamp, Added by User, Load Added Timestamp (TK why different?) Last Saved Timestamp, Last Saved User. 

If the Sterlizer is interfaced, and the tape has been received (and matched TK), then the following information will be pulled from the tape: 
Alarm, Cycle (Type), Temperature, Sterilization Time, Dry Time, (Cycle Details). 

If an active Competency exists for this Sterilizer AND I have an Approved and Current Competency record, then I can update the Load Result by selecting the appropriate button. If I do NOT have a valid Competency record, I will receive a message, and a Supervisor may do a temporary override for training purposes. See Load Results Competency for more information. 

I can update the Alarm by selecting from a list. 
I can update the Cycle by selecting from a list. Cycles to appear in the list can be controlled by the Group Cycles settings page. (Reference to Modifying Sterilizer Group Settings for more info.) 
I can update the Sterilant Batch.
